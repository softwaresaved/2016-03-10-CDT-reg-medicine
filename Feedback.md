# Feeback on sticky notes

## Automating tasks with the Unix shell

Good:

* Lots of commands to remember.
* Mistakes ruin it.
* What the commands/symbols actually mean e.g. $, $@. -n, -p
* Looping was confusing when we got to the more complex commands - simple loops made sense.
* I would prefer to have a workshop of a slower place.
* Confusing terminologyy gets confusing as I know what I want to do or write, but don't know the exact correct term such as "wildcard" or "directory"
* Easier analogies were easier to understannd like "folder" etc.

Bad:

* How to move/organise files into folders with commands/scripts.
* Way to easily move/copy/rename large numbers of files.
* I learned how to move large amount of filw while keeping the originals intact. This could be useful for image manipulation in my future project.
* Now know how to organise large numbers of files through direct input/scripts.
* All shortcuts useful like: $ history, $! number of command, cd ~ (Home/ useful shortcut), creating look do ... done, bash script.sh, creating a script.sh and rerun command.
* Having never used bash before, this introduction was a great way to start learning.
* Great examples, use of data made it relevant, good pace.
* Good use of online etherpad!

## Structured programming using Python

Good:

* File manipulation +automation through loops with unix shell
* File manipulation - clear introduction to use of software for a given purpose
* Good to know about using axis for arrays. Didn't really use it before. Going over strings and manipulation but maybe not relevant to data analysis much
* Great range of examples used, good coverage of introductory concepts
* Right difficulty challenges
* File manipulation + automation through loops with shell
* It was good, thanks
* Useful methods of quick data analysis - heat maps, mean for large datasets
* IPython notebook
* Exercises were helpful to force us to know how things work
* Was a lot of fun
* More problem solving
* Easy to edit previous input (Ipynb)

Bad:

* Would like more on pipeline
* Can't come up with anything
* Can't think of any bad points
* Other than simple data manipulation (min/max) tricky to relate to everyday use
* None
